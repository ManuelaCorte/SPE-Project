	abstract = {Financial Architecture aims sustainability of an economy by ensuring consistent growth rate.{GDP} is an indicator of the growth of an economy. Higher {GDP} of an economy reflects robust growth of an economy and vice-versa and as such every country tries to maximise the growth rate of {GDP} .There are certain macro factors operating in the economic environment that will influence the {GDP} growth rate. The study makes an attempt to determine the influence of selected economic variables namely Inflation, Exchange rate, Foreign exchange reserves, {FII}'s, Sensex, Balance of Payments and Current Fiscal Deficit on the {GDP} of an economy. The data is collected by using secondary sources relating to the selected Economic variables. The data is collected for a period of 15 years i.e. from 01-04-1997 to 31-03-2012 with annual intervals. The scope of the study is confined only to selected economic variables only. Correlation and {ANOVA} are used for analyzing the relationship between the {GDP} and selected economic variables. The study revealed that Exchange rate, Sensex and Balance of Payment reflected by current and capital account balances are the factors that significantly predict {GDP} of the economy.},

	abstract = {Economic growth can be defined as an increase in the ability of a country or region in providing for the economic needs of the population. High or low economic growth can be measured by calculating the gross domestic product ({GDP}). This study uses inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates as a supporting variable of {GDP}. There is a significant negative relationship of interest rates on {GDP} and a significant positive relationship of the exchange rates on the {GDP}, while inflation is not a significant influence on {GDP}.},

	abstract = {We point out that autocorrelated error terms require modification of the usual methods of estimation and prediction; and we present evidence showing that the error terms involved in most current formulations of economic relations are highly positively autocorrelated. In doing this we demonstrate that when estimates of autoregressive properties of error terms are based on calculated residuals there is a large bias towards randomness. We demonstrate how much efficiency may be lost by current methods of estimation and prediction; and we give a tentative method of procedure for regaining the lost efficiency.},

Specifically, we explore whether other macroeconomic variables such as population, interest rates, unemployment rates, amongst others, can be used to predict the {GDP} of a country. We also examine the impact of new variables on the model base model fit using p-values and variance inflation factor ({VIF}) as a performance metric. The {MLR} model appears to be a suitable model for determining a linear relationship between dependent and independent features.},
