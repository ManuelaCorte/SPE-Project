\begin{abstract}
  The relationship between economic indicators is a topic on interest for economists and policy makers to improve the lives of the citizens. In this project, we explore the relationship between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Inflation Rate (IR) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). We first conduct a preliminary analysis of the correlation between the variables and then we try to explicitly model them using two different approaches: the Prais-Winsten Model and the Hidden Markov Model. We then use the models to predict the GDP for the next year and compare the results. We find that the Hidden Markov Model is able to capture the dynamics of the data better than the Prais-Winsten Model, but our simplified analysis restricted it to only predict whether the GDP will increase or decrease. The Pais-Winsten Model, on the other hand, is able to predict the GDP value for the next years, but is not as reliable.
